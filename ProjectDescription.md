Enterprise Virtual Exchange (EVE) is a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that delivers illuminating connections between entrepreneurs, business owners, and specialized resources providers. EVE brings virtual training, networking, and special events to the entrepreneurs. Many small business owners spend the bulk of their time working their business and find it difficult to leave the shop to participate in activities that provide information and opportunities for business ideation, growth, and operational management. Therefore, we partner with small business advocates, certified Community Development Financial Institutions, and other small business resource providers to customize knowledge for business acumen and bring to the end-user on an easily accessible platform. EVE provides a direct connection through candid shared communication. The mission of EVE is to bring wisdom, key resources, and purposeful networking to build social capital and create space for innovative growth. EVE is a two-part virtual exchange marketplace: Educational resources for business owners include best practices for financing, industry standards, vendor management, organizational ideation, and legal matters. A bridge between companies, investors, and executive groups, with the necessary resources to catapult their businesses.
