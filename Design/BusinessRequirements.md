# Business Requirements

### BR1 - The platform being created should assist smaller businesses/entrepreneurs to make connections with larger businesses and provide a platform for business growth.
* This is a business requirement because the platform's purpose is to make space for small businesses to stay informed and learn more about their chosen industry. The business will be a bridge that creates new ideas between businesses and be a middle man for companies to establish connections.

### BR2 - The user will have access to resources such as educational videos, conferences, etc.
* Not everyone has the time to take in person educational classes/ conferences etc. This platform will give users, who are busy and do not have the time for in-person sessions, access to online resources.

### BR3 - The website sponsors shall be able to advertise their business and publish material on the website through their profile.
* This is a primary example of how people will grow their businesses. Reason being that this platform will allow for people to advertise and promote their own business along with helping others in the process. Since sponsors are advertising as well as publishing their own material, this will be directly related to business performance.

### BR4 - EVE should increase entrepreneurs’ knowledge in their industry.
* We are in a new day and age where people are more motivated and driven to become a business owner/entrepreneurs. This platform allows people and small business owners to expand their knowledge of the business industry, so they can have a better pathway for success. 

### BR5 - EVE should be easy for users to navigate, almost simulating a real life building with different resources offered in each room.
* This is a business requirement because it describes an objective for the web design. It is not so much something the website should do, but rather it is a business rule.

### BR6 - The business will respond to user’s request for new and remixed resources
* This is a requirement because the business needs to stay user-friendly, and by extension, it needs to maintain direct contact with the users.

### BR7 - Sponsorship agreements will be an option for companies to establish with the EVE business.
* EVE will need funding, and sponsorship will be its main form of support during the early stage of the platform. It is required of the business to fund its employees, therefore, offers for other companies to sponsor EVE should be available.
