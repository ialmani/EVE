# EVE Team TechStack
 
## Frontend
 
### Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript
### Frameworks: React
https://reactjs.org/
We chose React as it was a framework that we were comfortable with, and we agreed that it would 
prepare us to work with React Native if our client decides they also want a mobile app. 
 
## Backend
 
### Languages: Python
### Frameworks: Django
https://www.djangoproject.com/
This framework was recommended to us by our mentor. We looked at a variety of frameworks and chose Django because it seemed most familiar, 
and because numerous libraries for it were available (most importantly, libraries to support the JWT authentication system).

## Databases
 
### mySQL
https://www.mysql.com/
The two members of our team who volunteered to focus on the backend work of the project were both most familiar with mySQL
and found it as the best option for our project as it is a website.
