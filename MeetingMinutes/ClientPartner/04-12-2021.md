## Topics discussed
Client was able to request remote control of our screen via Zoom and interact with it like last time. She began by just going through each part of the website she has seen before and making suggestions about some of the new styling and some of the things she read. A common issue was that font-size in some elements were a bit too small. The last thing we discussed was a notification system of some kind maybe via email or inbox for members to see when sensors post content.

## Topics clarified
Our client went through with us to clarify that there should be more of a distinction between our “Contact Us” page and “Ask EVE”. The difference being one is related to the website itself and troubleshooting, and the other one is more of a platform for asking questions more specific to business and the educational content on the website. Also our client said she was going to be sending us a voice over or some kind of audio for us to put into the website’s trailer section.

## Client Feedback
Some specific feedback from our client included adding a new navbar button for contact us, adding a back button for most of the pages as well as possibly some way to notify a user when something is posted.
