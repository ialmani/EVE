## Topics Discussed
We presented the design material to our client, Amina, and received feedback for each section. We then discussed what needs to be changed in our material based on her feedback. We had a few questions that we asked. We discussed the design aspect in detail.

## Things Clarified
Different permissions for the different accounts on the website. Everybody should have access to articles but only member can access all the other resources and make comments.
Everybody should have access to articles but only members can access all the other resources and make comments. 
The logo needs fixation. Change the top two points of the letter V. The circles below are too round so work on that.
Ask EVE link should be added to the navigation bar and the sponsor packages link should be removed and added as a ribbon on the right side of the home page.
Logo should have the slogan when navigating to other pages.
