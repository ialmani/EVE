## Topics Discussed
We presented the design material to our client, Amina, and received feedback for each section. We then discussed what needs to be changed in our material based on her feedback. We had a few questions that we asked. We discussed the design aspect in detail.

## Things Clarified
Different permissions for the different accounts on the website. Everybody should have access to articles but only member can access all the other resources and make comments. She would like the sponsor packages link to be added as a ribbon on the right side of the home page.
Logo should have the slogan when navigating to other pages. She clarified that she wanted us to build an experience for the user when they are accessing different resources that make them seem like they are in person. She also wants a "login for more" button for people who are not members/sponsors to be able to access other resources on the website that are only for members.

## Client Feedback
She wants us to edit the logo to make it look more like keys and accentuate the word EVE in the logo. For example make the top of the keys pointed and bottom less round. Ask EVE link should be added to the navigation bar. Overall, she really liked it and appreciated our efforts.
