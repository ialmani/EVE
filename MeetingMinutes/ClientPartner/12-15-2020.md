## Topics Discussed
We presented the design material to our client, Amina, and received feedback for each section. We then discussed what needs to be changed in our material based on her feedback. We had a few questions that we asked. We discussed the design aspect in detail

## Things Clarified
Different permissions for the different accounts on the website. Everybody should have access to articles but only members can access all the other resources and make comments. The logo needs fixation. 


## Client Feedback
She wants a ribbon for on the right side of the page for people to be able to see sponsor packages. ASK EVE should be added as link on the navigation bar. She also wants keywords for articles so its easy for people to search the topics they would want to read about. The logo should have the slogan when navigating to other pages.
