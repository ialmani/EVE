## Topics Discussed
 
We discussed how we were going to proceed with the first iteration. We decided the best way to do this would be to create two folders, one for the front end and the other for the backend so that we could push changes to it, and then later push the final code to the main branch. 

## Things Clarified
We made sure everything was properly installed and set up on each device. (React, Python, and Django).
We created two folders, one for the front end and the other for the back end, and also a new branch so that the initial commits are made to it. We then will be pushing the code we collectively think is needed for the first iteration to the main branch.
