Topics Discussed
Seeing how the AskEVE backend is going so we can send emails through the front end. Getting someone to make the profile page dynamic so when someone login they see their name. Finding work to spreadout amongst the group while we have the time. 

Things Clarified
AskEVE backend is coming along needs more work but is coming along. Two members will work together on how to get our profile page to be dynamic so if you sign in it shows your name. The rest of the group found areas of the site to work on before the deadline.
