## Topics Discussed
We spoke about the recent additions and changes that were made to the project by each member, 
and what we needed to work on next so that iteration 2 functionalities are fully complete. Since 
we drastically changed the codebase after the first iteration (to allow testing), we also worked 
through the errors that some team members were getting when replicating the new environment. 
We also spoke about the changes that need to be made to the project documentation, as per the 
codebase change mentioned above. Lastly, we worked on the assignment due tonight â€” comparing our iteration with others'.

## Topics Clarified
What tasks were completed, and what we each need to work on next. Reminded everyone of the tasks 
regarding testing and functionality that need to be prioritized. The expected "deadlines" for each 
of our tasks since the iteration deadline is approaching. What assignments we need to complete as 
a team before the end of the semester.
