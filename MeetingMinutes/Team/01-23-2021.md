## Topics Discussed
Going over what we attempted to do over winter break so we know what to base our next steps. Talked about what our next steps were for our project to refine the Website and code base. Went over how to Dockerize the project as specified by the professor for our Third Iteration. Worked the Deadline for Third Iteration to better fit our schedules. Talked about our tests and went over how we can better them to professors standards. 
 
## Topics Clarified
Explaining how we did less than what we were all hoping to do during winter break.  Went over what we should be focusing on during the next few weeks to complete Third Iteration. We agreed to focus on Docking the project now since we believed it may be a little challenging for us to do. Instead of dividing the project up, we decided that we should all understand the same process while we have the time.
