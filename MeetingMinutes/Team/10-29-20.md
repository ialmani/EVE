## Topics Discussed
We discussed collectively how we were going to attack the comparing our team to others assignment. We decided that we were going to split up the work and collaboratively, and simultaneously, work on it together in a google document. We proofreaded each other's work as we went and asked questions about things we were unsure of. We worked on the assignment here for pretty much the whole meeting. Afterwards, we decided on what to do before our assignment due date, which was for each of us to do a final proofreading of the assignment and send confirmation to our group in slack. Once everyone’s confirmation is sent in, then the assignment could be submitted.

## Topics Clarified
What the assignment required and how to best complete it. We spoke about each question we had to answer for the assignment, and what it would be referring to (i.e Domain). Being able to see other groups’ work helped us get a clear idea of what our group needs to improve and/or is doing correctly.
