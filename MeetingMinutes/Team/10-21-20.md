## Topics Discussed
One of todayâ€™s topics included dividing up the workload for the assignments that we are going to accomplish this week. Another topic is how we are going to approach creating our presentation based on recommendations from Ben. We discussed how exactly we wanted to email our client as well as gathered our availability as a team to efficiently attend all our meetings. We discussed possible times for a presentation date and then chose one. The last thing was we talked about how we thought we should present our work to the client and how it should be shown in the presentation as well.

## Things Clarified
We clarified how we want to present our design materials - how we are splitting up the different slides, the presentation style, and the duration of each slide. We agreed on preparing our respective slides by Sunday, rehearsing on Monday, and then presenting on Tuesday at 5:20pm.
