## Topics Discussed

Discussed how we are going to get in touch with our client to get the software to her. We decided that we will just send her the repository link for now and if she decides down the line to take ownership, it can happen as soon as she reaches out and creates a github account.
All of us said our goodbyes and went on our way.
