## Topics Discussed
 
We discussed how we were going to incorporate pull requests and code review to avoid any conflicts. It was a short meeting mainly about pull requests and how we were going to implement it. We also spoke about our next meeting which weâ€™ll dedicate to reviewing the third iteration project cards/tasks.

## Things Clarified
Mera demonstrated the PR process on github: how to create one, how to review/leave comments, and how to resolve conflicts. We will be working on a separate branch other than the develop and main because we want to make sure none of us breaks the code while working on it. We will create pull requests and request another team member to review it. Then once reviewed and approved by another team member for merge, we'll go ahead and merge it.
