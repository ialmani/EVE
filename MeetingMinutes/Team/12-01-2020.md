## Topics Discussed
We talked about how we should focus on our attack of Iteration 2 of EVE.
Our group got our ideas ready to accomplish the functionality that the professor is asking for. We took some time to divide the workload up between the group.
We discussed how we need to do better at communicating with each other to be more beneficial as a whole.
Discussed how talking more to one another will help us in the long run because we are dependant on one another
We worked on implementing client feedback so we can better tailor EVE to how our client wants it to look.
 
## Topics Clarified
We clarified what we need to do for Iteration 2 in order to have more functionality that will be usable by our client.
Brainstormed what sections of the project we will be tackling individually so we can accomplish more this time around.
