## Topics Discussed
We decided to meet and see what our progress was for the second iteration. Every member of the group had pretty much completed their tasks. The navbar of the website was breaking every time we changed css for other pages, and we couldnâ€™t figure out why that was happening.
 
## Topics Clarified
The navbar kept breaking because * and body {} in the css files were changing the styling for the whole website. It took a while to figure that out so we decided to make it look decent for now and then later work on the css to make the website look presentable. Since functionality is the most important for the second iteration, we have decided to focus on that for now.
