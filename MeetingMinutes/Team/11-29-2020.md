## Topics Discussed

We discussed our mentor’s feedback about the first iteration. We also discussed our client’s feedback and what next we should be doing. Austin suggested that we use the “issues” feature on github to be able to keep track of all the features that we need to implement. We agreed that our team needed to communicate more for the second iteration.


## Topics Clarified

The second iteration features such as the resources page should have articles and video blogs. We’ll change the color combination for the front-end; Amina sent us a few colors so we’re going to work on that. Other than that, we need to change all the styled components (JavaScript) files into CSS styling files so that we can test the front end; we couldn’t figure out testing with the styled components. Anything that we missed in the first iteration would be our goal for the second iteration.
