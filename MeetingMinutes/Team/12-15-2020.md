## Topics Discussed
We talked about the finalization for the second and how it turned out, how we all improved this iteration on taking a task getting it done before the deadline it was due, working on the presentation for the showcase, getting the time and day when to meet mentor and client to show and discuss what we have, and what are break plans for winter will be and what we want to do on the project.
 
## Topics Clarified
We finished the second iteration of the project and showed working functionality  for it, we all agreed that we as a group have made improvements in coming together to work but also working on it in a timely manner, figuring out what days and time are the best to meet Ben and Amina to show them our progress, and seeing what we all plan to do for winter break in terms of what we want to do on the project.
