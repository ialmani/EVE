## Topics Discussed
We discussed various aspects of the frontend such as the navigation bar, the Ask EVE contact form, the landing page video, and other aesthetic factors of the website. 
Mainly, we worked through some issues that we were running into with the navigation bar and its testing. Essentially, the implementation of a new responsive nav bar
had caused some of our previous frontend tests to fail. However, we were able to identify the root of the problem and reach an agreement on how to best handle it.
We then discussed everyone's progress so far and reviewed each others' work. Lastly, we were able to assign new tasks to each team member in preparation for tomorrow's
deadline. 

## Topics Clarified
We solidified our final goals for this iteration and their respective tasks, as well as, assigned one to each person. We also agreed to meet tomorrow with most (if
not all) of our assignments complete for a final team review before the submission. Also, we clarified what we were able to complete for the three main priorities 
of this iteration (aesthetics, functionality, and testing.) which include the commenting functionality, ask eve form, both frontend and backend tests, refactoring,
and enhancing the site's aesthetics.
