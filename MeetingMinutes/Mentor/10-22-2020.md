## Topics Discussed

We spoke to Ben, our mentor, and presented our design materials to him. He then gave us feedback regarding each section. 
We then discussed what needs to be changed in our material based on his feedback, and we made the changes together. Ben also 
gave us some tips for the client meeting - which we agreed will be taking place on Saturday the 24th at 12:00pm.

## Things Clarified

Client meeting date and time was solidified. Took note of the feedback and improvements on the design material were agreed upon. 
We agreed to include checkboxes in the tasks in our project managment client (Git Projects) and to check them as we work through the task. 
Ben clarified the best way to present the prototype to the client was to remind her that this is only a prototype and that the design is not 
complete just yet; The main focus is the content and the functionality.
