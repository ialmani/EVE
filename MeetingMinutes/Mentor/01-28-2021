## Topics Discussed

During our meeting, we showed Ben how we dockerized both the frontend and backend. We also had a couple questions about docker and CI/CD that Ben clarified.
We discussed the CI/CD process and any tools for integration and deployment that Ben would recommend. We spoke briefly about the changes that we have made so far
and how we intend to proceed for this iteration. As discussed with Ben, we will be shifting our focus towards dockerizing, automated testing and integration, and 
refactoring during this iteration (as opposed to functionality in the past iterations). Lastly, we mentioned the documentation and our plans for the 4th iteration cards in Git projects. 

## Things Clarified

Ben clarified that we could either have both the frontend and the backend in one docker container, however, recommended that we have them in separate containers. 
He also clarified the continuous integration process in detail. We agreed that we would focus on continuous integration this iteration and continuous deployment
in upcoming iterations. We also decided to consider GitHub Actions and Amazon ECS for our project as Ben recommended them. As for the 4th iteration discussion, we 
agreed to have another meeting with Ben later during this iteration to discuss them in more depth as we would have a better idea of what was accomplished in the 
3rd iteration and what still needs to be done/prioritized in the next.
