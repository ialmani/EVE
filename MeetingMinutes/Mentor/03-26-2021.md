## Topics Discussed
In today’s meeting, we went over all of the usual stuff. We started by updating Ben on our progress that we had made on iteration 5. Specifically, we had discussed the payment setup for the sponsor packages, backend testing, and deployment of the website. Overall, he said we were doing great and should make sure we have everything figured out as soon as we can.

## Topics Clarified
Ben suggested we look into free options for deploying such Heroku. He mentioned that there are many libraries we can look into that will do a lot of work for us if we’re using Herkoku.  Another thing he suggested is Stripe for setting up the payment option. He elaborated why stripe is convenient; it can be set up with api to test failed and real transactions - api can be used for real payments and mock payments. Hence, it would be easy to create the stripe check out process and test the transactions by sending out mock requests. Lastly, he recommended that we moved tests to a helper test class.
