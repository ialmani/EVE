## Topics Discussed

We spoke to Ben about the four assignments that are due on the 22nd. He suggested using Git projects for when we begin to code the software. 
We also agreed that the first iteration software should be the top priorirty for now, so that we can use the software when writing the documentation. 
For the User Documentation, Ben clarified that we should keep in mind each step to a functionality when explaining how to use it, and that it would be helpful
to reference the use cases while working on this assignment. We decided to work on the Development documentation while setting up Docker for our project so 
we can keep better manage our time. 


## Things Clarified

The User Documentation was clarified by Ben as something similar to a FAQ page or a user manual. Ben also told us that it would be best to separate the frontend 
and backend folders into their own repos. This is to make it easier to clone one part of the project without having to deal with all the other files. He also
clarifieid that they should each have their own read me file. Lastly, Ben explained that we should have a requirments.txt file for our Django backend to make 
replicating the backend easier.
